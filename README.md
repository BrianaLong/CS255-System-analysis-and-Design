# CS255-System-analysis-and-Design
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The DriverPass project is a system that the client Liam wanted to create for his buisness. The goal of the system is to provide an application that he can use in his buisness to organize driving tests and lessons for people who want assistance in getting their drivers license. I did a particulary well job at creating a buisness requirement document. One part of my work on the documents I would revise would be the slide set. I feel it was my weakest work and could have more detailed charts. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing the system. Without this it can create a confusing and often buggy application. When designing software in the future I will use the interview technique to gather requirments and an elementary mock up with the client. I would then create a GANTT chart to make a timeline. And lastly I would use UML class diagram to organize actions and classes.
